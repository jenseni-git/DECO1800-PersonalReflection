                <div class="segment-body">
                    <p>I start this reflection by saying that I really enjoyed making the process portfolio. I started my design by thinking about what I wanted on the front page. It had to represent me, and show a new user that this was my portfolio and hence, I briefly sketched out the following wireframe: </p>
                    <img width="60%" src="images/initialWireFrame.png" alt="Image of Home Page wireframe" title="Home Page wireframe">
                    <p>After this, having talked so much about interactivity and engagement, I ideated a couple of ways in which to make the index page engaging. Trying to incorporate movement into the screen, I eventually came up with the side-scrolling as is implemented now. In hindsight, I feel it might have been better to develop this after completing the website rather than before.</p>
                    <img width="60%" src="images/min.indexFlow.jpg" alt="Image of Home Page flow diagram" title="Home Page flow diagram">
                    <p>With some engagement created, and a wireframe of the initial homepage, I had a think about how the whole website would sit. Referencing the brief, I documented a full site-map. I considered the design choice of separating the assignment components into different webpages, and noted this, however ultimately they were left combined for continuity, as well as ease of access</p>
                    <img width="80%" src="images/headerDesign.png" alt="Image of Header Sketch" title="Header Sketch">
                    <p>Next, was colour. After looking at a couple of different sites, I stumbled across <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.happyhues.co/">Happy Hues UI Palletes</a> ('Happy Hues', 2019). This website shows, as it says, curated colours in the context of a webpage. I found this really useful to understand the different ways in which colours match together to make a User Interface. This website did not contain any colours which I liked however, so I moved to <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://coolors.co/071013-dd3d58-ccfbfe-cdd6dd-cdaca1">Coolors.co</a> ('Coolors', 2014) to generate a colour set (as linked), and stumbled on the current set.</p>
                    <p>From here, it was mostly a process of sticking the content together. A lot of CSS was completed along the way, however I feel the basis from the homepage was a good template to follow. In reflection, I would have liked to spend a bit more time on the User Experience of the website, however I think a lot of my time was spent styling small elements. Overall, I am relatively happy with how it has turned out, and I would be happy to publish this publicly.</p>
