                        <p>My name is Iain Jensen and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Information Systems. My hobbies include coding and web security, and making wooden and plastic replica models in my spare time.</p>

                        <p>The A1 Project brief entailed keeping a portfolio of work throughout the semester, documenting our individual work and progress in the course. This portfolio was then compiled into a website for display and progress demonstration purposes.</p>

                        <p>Project A2 was a Pass/Fail exploration that consisted of ideating a potential project concept for further development within a later assignment. For this project I developed the idea of a game, titled <em>That's Rubbish</em>.</p>

                        <p>The A3 Rapid Design Sprint and Reflection was a two part assignment. Firstly, with a team, I undertook the process of completing a past-paced ideation session to develop a plausible idea for assignment A4. A reflection on this process, as well as a comparison to the process of A4 was then conducted.</p>

                        <p>Assignment A4 was a group assignment, where we were tasked with creating a website to engage users with open government datasets, and provide a meaningful interaction for them with this data. The final product was a website titled <em>RideSafe</em>.</p>
