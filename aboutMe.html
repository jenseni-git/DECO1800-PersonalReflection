                            <p>My name is Iain Jensen and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Information Systems at the University of Queensland.</p>
                            <p>I am in my first year of uni, having finished high school last year, and started off the year in the IT/Business Management dual, transferring to IT this semester to focus on Software. Throughout this year I have gained an interest in Web and Information security, participating in numerous Capture the Flag competitions. In my spare time, I code for fun, and am currently working on a multiplayer monopoly-type game. I also have an interest for web security, and making wooden and plastic replica models - I have a keen eye for detail.</p>
                            <p>With my experiences so far, in the future I would like to work in the field of Software Development, Cybersecurity or consulting</p>
