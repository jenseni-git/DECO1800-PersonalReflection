                    <p>Overall, I am glad I took this course. If I think back to the start of the course, I thought the course would have more of a UX/UI focus, however, I have still learnt so many other things.</p>
                    <p>I feel it is nice to explicitly teach APIs as they are such an integral part of the web, and networks in general, and in a way that is friendly to beginners to programming (post-DECO1400), is very helpful. I can not say I learnt much about APIs that I did not already know, however, I will definitely take away more ideation methods than I started with. The teamwork aspect as a whole as well has helped me further develop leadership and teamwork skills. Learning the teamwork information at the start of the course might have been more helpful so that problems in the team could be identified earlier, and managed more effectively. In this light, I have learnt that I need to be more explicit in my communication of goals to others. Looking back to previous reflections, I see that we had problems towards the start in regard to getting ideas from Mengxuan and Alan. Having that experience, and working through the course with them, I feel has helped me understand the difficulties of a language barrier, and I believe I am better equipped to deal with such a situation now.</p>
                    <p>I am really happy with the final product we were able to develop by the end of the course. While it possibly lacked interaction and engagement, I believe, with extra time, the extra ideas we ideated but did not implement, would excel it to the next level.</p>
