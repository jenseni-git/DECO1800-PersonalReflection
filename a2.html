                    <p>I feel that my A2 design process was very random. During the ideation phases before the A2 assignment I was really enjoying working with the transport datasets. More detailed information can be found under Entry 2 and Entry 3 of my Journal, however, in summary I was confident with generating ideas in that space. As I note in my journal <q>I [had] found Public transport and Public spaces the most interesting groups so far</q>, and I feel this was because while I have used public transport every day for the past 7 years, I also love being out in nature.</p>

                    <p>I found the constraints exercise very useful, and although it was difficult at first, the ideation that came out of it was informative. In the future I will definitely use this ideation method more.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it was time to pick a design inspiration topic. After more iterations using the design constraints ideation method, I was getting bored. The public transport and public spaces groups were generating some positive ideas, however they were not interactive or engaging enough. I was ideating at home when the school bell to a local school rang, and from that, the <em>That's Rubbish</em> game was mostly designed. I was reminded of the talks we always got in class about making sure we put the right things in the right bin, and I wanted to replicate that in a gamified way. A quiz format, with draggable items, I figured would be interactive.</p>

                    <p>As can be seen in the final design, a couple additions were made to the concept. The main one was another effort to make it more engaging, by converting the weights of amounts of rubbish to the equivalent weight in number of animals. I thought this would be a suitable API integration, to select a random animal, and that it would provide the user with more of an emotional connection.</p>
                    <p>I was quite proud of my design, and a bit disappointed I didn't get to iterate it further. Although the ideation process itself wasn't that structured, I take away the lesson of trying to change up your environment if you're struggling to ideate. While the constraints ideation method was effective, and I will consider it for use in future projects, sometimes drawing ideas from the surrounding environment is just as effective, or even better.</p>
